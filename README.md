# SDSS_Data_analysis

This is example code showing the importing and preparation of a composite spectrum and subsequent statistical analysis of .fits file data (converted to .csv, normalised and rebinned and then passed to a pandas dataframe) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16.

This was initally created to form a composite spectrum of luminous quasars from the SDSS DR16 sample to identify species present in the spectra by determining peak position, height and FWHM using a gaussian distribution.
